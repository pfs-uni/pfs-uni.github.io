                    Welcome to my Intro to Information Technology lecture website.

                    What is your interest in IT?
                </div>
                <div class="qa-a">
                    I have had long interest in IT.  I started working as an
                    application and database developer in the late 90's. I left the
                    industry in the early 2000's to start the first of several of
                    my own businesses.  Mostly, I find the problem solving and 
                    the ability to make your own tools very satisfying. Networks
                    are interesting and a recent Rasberry Pi purchase has inspired
                    me to start building a basic computer from scratch using
                    breadboards and EEPROM chips.

                    When did your interest in IT start?
                </div>
                <div class="qa-a">
                    I began to get interested in computers in the 80's with an
                    Apple 2e computer.  It was mostly playing games, but eventually,
                    led to some basic programming.

                <div class="qa-q">
                    Was there a particular event or person that sparked your
                    interest in IT?
                </div>
                <div class="qa-a">
                    I always had a background interest in computers, so when
                    things really started to explode in the 90's with the growing
                    popularity of the web, I decided to focus on on programming
                    and database developement.

                    Outline your IT experience
                </div>
                <div class="qa-a">
                    I've been out of the industry for a long time.  I worked as a
                    programmer and database developer in the 90's and early 2000's.
                    I jumped ship to start a business in the food industry.  It
                    was always useful to know how to set up a server and automate 
                    administrative processes.  More recently, I have been involved
                    in CNC machines and CAD and CAM programming.  I recently
                    completed a Linux administration certification which led me
                    to want to pursue the Bachelor of IT with RMIT.

                <div class="qa-q">
                    Why did you choose to come to RMIT? 
                </div>
                <div class="qa-a">
                    It appeared as though RMIT has been focused on offering 
                    web based courses for awhile. The university has good reputation
                    and the courses on offer seemed to fit what I was looking for.

                    What do you expect to learn during your studies?   
                </div>
                <div class="qa-a">
                    I'm looking to get a broad range of skills.  In particular, 
                    I hoping to update my knowledge in programming and to also 
                    learn about more modern project methodologies and design 
                    principles.
