            <h5>What is your interest in IT?</h5>
            <p>I have had long interest in IT.  I started working as an
            application and database developer in the late 90's. I left the
            industry in the early 2000's to start the first of several of
            my own businesses.</p>
            <p>I started developing in Visual Basic and SQL Server.  I worked
            for some big investment banks both here in Australia and the UK.
            The Y2K bug was great fun at the time! I currently spend a lot of
            my time in Linux.</p>
            <p>I have always kept coding at some level for myself and love the
            problem solving that IT involves.  I'm a process and efficiency nerd
            that loves to try to build a better mousetrap!</p>
            <p>My goals for the course are to broaden my skill set and to achieve
            a good quality professional certification for work.  I've recently
            recieved a Linux certification and have moved back into the industry.
            I am also considering an engineering degree after completing my studies.</p>
            <p>I chose RMIT for its good reputation.  They seem to have made a 
            good committment to the online learning space and I and am hoping to be 
            challenged and educated.</p>
