                <b>RESULT:</b>INTJ-a [architect]
                <p>The result from the test indicates that I have a quick, imaginative and strategic
                    mind. I am confident, hard working and determined. I am open minded and a
                    jack of all trades. </p>
                <p>On the negative side, I can be arrogant, judgemental, overly analytical and do
                not like highly structure environments.</p>
                <p>In a team environment, it may be important to find other members that are willing
                to commit to an active environment.  I may need to be careful about being overly
                critical and ensure that I am supporting team mates appropriately and provide at
                environment where questions and experimentation are valued.</p>

                I took two tests
                <ul>
                    <li>ThoughtCo.com</li>

                </ul>
                <div>
                    The results seem to indicate that I learn best by doing. In a team environment,
                    it means I like to discuss a problem with others and then experience the problem
                    and talk about the findings with others.
                    <p>The implications for a team will be to look for members who are willing
                    to admit they don't know something and are able to talk through a problem. Good
                    communicators who like to get their hands dirty are good potential team mates.</p>
