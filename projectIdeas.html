                    <span class="projectTitle1"><em>!BuyShite</em></span>&nbsp;is a phone app and
                    browser extension to help you save money! Australians love to
                    gamble, so we are leveraging that knowledge to help incentivise
                    members to save money and not spend it.  We are applying the 
                    approach of a 'No Lose Lottery' with a twist to help build
                    the savings of low income Australians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everytime you are about to buy something, our app
                    <span class="projectTitle1"><em>!BuyShite</em></span>&nbsp;jumps in and asks
                    you if you really need to buy it.  We then offer you the
                    alternative to put the money or some additional amount into
                    a savings account.

                <p class="lastP">
                    Here's the great part, every time you deposit money into the
                    savings account, you increase your chances to win a monthly
                    lottery for people who deposit savings!

                    Many Australians don't save enough money to handle even small
                    emergencies.  I know what that feels like because I've been
                    there too. There are also a proliferation of 'fintech'
                    services encouraging everyone to buy now and pay later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It doesn't have to be this way though. 'No Lose Lotteries'
                    have been proven to be succesful ways to increase the
                    savings of all kinds of people but especially those on
                    low incomes.

                <p class="lastP">
                    Lotteries, as they exist today, only extract money out of
                    people.  However, many people with low incomes feel this
                    is the only way they will every have the opportunity to
                    make a large enough sum of money.  We think we can help

                    In a nutshell, its a way to incentivise savings by using
                    peoples love of gambling in a positive way.
                </p>
                <p>There are two parts to the application
                    <ol>
                        <li>Phone Application</li>
                        <li>Web Browser Add-In</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Features the application will require are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Detect when a shopping cart order is about to
                            be placed.</li>
                        <li>Notify the user and ask if they really want to
                            purchase the item.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If yes, give them the opportunity to deposit
                                the rounding difference</li>
                            <li>If no, ask if they would like to deposit the
                                full amount of the purchase into the saving
                                account instead.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Track all spending below $20.00</li>
                        <li>Set savings goals</li>
                        <li>Show details about people who have won each month</li>
                        <li>Show the amount possible to win</li>
                        <li>Link to financial institution</li>
                        <li>Show how much money has been saved</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In total</li>
                            <li>per month</li>
                            <li>saved because of cancelled spending</li>
                            <li>saved when rounding up purchases</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="lastP">Some of the obstacles will be determining what financial
                    rules and laws will be applicable.  Lotteries are 
                    State run and a major source of revenue, this could
                    present a problem if they feel this reduces their
                    potential income.  Privacy is also a major concern as
                    we are dealing with sensitive financial data.

                This application requires only software to be developed.  Initially,
                the application will be written in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript for
                the user interface and browser extension.  Due to the security
                concerns, an application will probably need to be developed for each
                type of phone operatings system the application will run on.

                Most of the phone application and web coding skills are reasonably
                common to find today.  Integration with other services is likely
                to be beneficial, so a solid understanding of how financial
                applications work will be a high priority.  In order to reach
                the most number of people, it will be necessary to also be able
                to reach out to groups and organisations whose social goals may be
                aligned with ours.

                    Successful implementation of this project could have far reaching

                    be an ongoing challenge.

                <p class="lastP">
                    Uptake of the application will help provide a way to boost
                    Australians savings mentality and reduce the day to day stress
                    many of our fellow citizens feel.  Increasing happiness and
                    a sense of security and control over ones life are not
                    unreasonable or insignificant expected outcomes.
