            <h5>What's your ideal job?</h5>
            <p>I'm a jack of all trades. It's a hard question to answer.  I love
            helping others succeed and seeing them grow.  I also love looking at
            how 'things are done' and trying to reimagine and improve processes.
            So long as I have an interesting problem to solve, I'm happy.
            </p>
            <p>I currently work for an amazing organisation.  If I were to be
            looking, I think I would enjoy a consultating role with a company
            like Redhat.</p>
