                    The job I have selected as a 'dream' job is as a consultant with
                    open source giant Redhat, now part of IBM.  As a consultant you are
                    required to maintain good contact and relationships with a variety
                    of clients.  A high level of technical skill is also required in
                    order that you can provide customers with answers and give them the
                    confidence that you can support their varied needs.
                </p>
                <p class="lastP">
                    What I find appealing about a role like this is that you need to be
                    technically skilled but you also have contact with a wide variety
                    of people. It's a real benefit about consulting work that you
                    are able to assist your customers to reach their goals.  The varied
                    nature of the work, troubleshooting, researching and thinking about
                    how to best help a client before they even know it, is exciting and
                    rewarding.
